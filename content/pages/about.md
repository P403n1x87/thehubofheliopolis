### Synopsis

Gabriele has a curiosity that's hard to appease. Since a early age he's always
been intrigued by Science and Nature and wanted to know more about its
fundamental laws. Together with his taste for abstraction as a way to find order
and rigour in things, he embarked on an adventure to learn about Physics and
Mathematics. He likes Technology very much too, a trait you could have guessed
if you had the chance to see him crack open any gizmos he came across to see
what was inside and understand how they worked.

A list of all my academic publications can be found on

### Main Projects

Currently, my main project is [Austin](https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin), a
frame stack sampler for CPython which can be used to build powerful statistical
profilers for Python applications that don't require instrumentation and have
minimal impact on the application runtime, making it ideal for profiling in
production.
