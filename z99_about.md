# Hey there

I'm **Gabriele** and I was born in a small town in Sicily, Italy, in September 1987. My background is in **Science and Technology**. I have a **BSc in Physics**, an **MSc in Theoretical Physics** and a **PhD in Pure Mathematics**. I have a fervid curiosity that pushes me to explore new technologies as they come out, and this blog is the place where I collect my experiences, both for sharing them with other and for personal note-keeping.

Currently, I work as a **Software Engineer**, based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
